# Python-E2E-Django-App
This is the App where I will be designing a whole new Full fledged Python App which will work End to End from having login/Registering Events to Post /Update/delete a blog like Social Media App. I am learning and making this out of my own Curiosity to get my hands dirty in the Python development. I am making this REpository as Public so that you can access it. Also I am making this app with the help of Corey Schefer's YouTube Video Series.

I have also created the day-wise branches to get to know the Code please look at the branches - feature/Django-<DayNumber>

Day one - 
  To create Django App - 
  Simply run command 
  django-admin startproject <Project_Name>
  It will automatically all project folders and files for you.
  To run the server you just need to run the Command-
    python manage.py runserver

Day Two -
  Run command -
  python manage.py startapp <AppName>
  It will automatically add files for you for the App
  You can add views, routes, funtions etc.
